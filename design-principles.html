        <p>Contrast compels the observer to notice important details within the work. 
            In this case the background is solid black, and the more noticeable elements 
            of this web page are the title, which is a blue green gradient color scheme 
            as well as a large heavy font, and the get started button which is colored 
            green and when examined more closely does not have black text but a dark blue 
            color. These elements as well as the banner at the top stand out because they 
            are the only ones that are colored.</p>

        <h1>Hick's Law</h1>
        <h2>Alibaba</h2>
        <a href="alibaba.com">alibaba.com</a>
        <img src="images\alibaba.jpg">
        <p>Hicks law describes the time it takes for a person to decide as a result of the
             possible choices. The greater number of choices there are, the longer amount
             of time it will take to decide. Alibaba’s website it is packed with as many 
             choices as I've ever seen. I suppose the goal of this is to keep the user on
              the page for as long as possible.</p>

    <div class="designElement">
        <h1>Visual Hierarchy</h1>
        <h2>Patek Philippe</h2>
        <a href="patek.com">patek.com</a>
        <img src="images\patek.jpg">
        <p>Visual hierarchy is the strategic placement of elements designed to influence users’
             perceptions and guide them to desired actions. Notice that on the front page of the 
             Patek website, the biggest element is the picture of a watch that they are promoting.
              This is to draw the user’s attention first, and designed in a way that the quality 
              and craftsmanship of the watch “stands out”</p>
